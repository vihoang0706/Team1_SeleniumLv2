##Technology and Framework
Technology Used : Java, TestNG, Selenium, Maven
Framework Used: Page Object Model

1. Java 8
2. IntelliJ IDEA ( It is an integrated development environment written in Java for developing computer software)
or any tools you prefer
3. java and jar on the PATH (make sure you use java executable from JDK but not JRE).
   To test this, try running the command javac. This command won't exist if you only have the JRE installed. 
   If you're met with a list of command-line options, you're referencing the JDK properly.

##How to run this project
There are 2 ways to run Selenium project
+ Run on local
+ Run via Selenium Grid

1. Run on local
    
    You can go ```{root project}\Team1_SeleniumLv2\src\main\resources\suites\testsuites.xml``` file to edit the parameter 
    "runOn" with value "local"

2. Run via Selenium Grid
Firstly, you should set up the environment. On this project, we have already defined how to create a grid and hub on the 
```resource/grid``` folder. You can go to this project and run 2 files .bat (```grid_hub.bat``` and ```grid_node.bat```) in case you run
on windows platform

In case, you want to run test scripts by parallel, you can config file ```testsuites.xml``` as below:

```<test name="UserManagement" parallel="classes" thread-count="1">```

On this file, you define all test cases you want to run on there.
After that, right clicking on ```testsuites.xml``` and run test scripts.
